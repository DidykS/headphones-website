# Sunnyside Landing Page

In this project, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It works well on both Desktop and Mobile devices. This template focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. I use JS for the mobile navigation toggle and for the fixed header.

_The idea of the design was taken from the Frontend Mentor website._
